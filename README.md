A Soccer Player & Quote Reader web app was built in this project. The Ionic mobile application was used to write the app that reads soccer player data, flag data, and quotes from internet resources.

The complete list of players available in the database is displayed by the app if no age group is selected. If only one of the values is presented, the search is returned according to the age limits of the search.

To improve the user experience, the layout for data entry and the arrangement of results in the table have been optimized.

Functions have been implemented in the settings page to check the list of country IDs and another function to check the search history.

On the home page, the player's table can be sorted by first and last name. When a valid search is performed, however, an appropriate message is displayed on the screen instead of the table if no results are returned.
